    [X] Need a way to see black/red board squares

    [X] Add a "game" CLI (or game "mode" to editor?..) where you can
        only move your pieces, AIs move theirs, and you take turns.

    [X] Add a way to see which moves a given piece could make, just by
        hovering over it.

    [X] Need undo/redo in editor

    [ ] Add some randomness to AI move choosing:
        Pick a move from the set of all moves within e.g. 0.1 score of
        the best move.

    [ ] Add a way to see which moves the AIs just made.

    [ ] Add "end of board squares", which allow pawns to turn into
        queens etc

    [ ] MAYBE: add pawns which can go back and forth??? ↔ ↕

    [ ] Start building up a number of saved boards, and then think
        about how to connect them up into a series of "levels".

    [ ] When you take a team's king (all of a team's kings?..) you get
        its pieces.


SCENARIOS:

    [ ] A regular chess game... but with a third team's pawns
        coming in from one side, out of holes in the wall
