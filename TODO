TODO:

    [ ] Add "end of board squares", which allow pawns to turn into
        queens etc

    [X] Need a way to see black/red board squares

    [ ] Need undo/redo in editor

    [ ] Add some randomness to AI move choosing:
        Pick a move from the set of all moves within e.g. 0.1 score of
        the best move.

    [ ] MAYBE: add pawns which can go back and forth??? ↔ ↕


SCENARIOS:

    [ ] A regular chess game... but with a third team's pawns
      coming in from one side, out of holes in the wall
